# Quantum Computing for H2 electronic structure.
Calculation of the ground state energy of the H2 molecule with the STO-nG minimal basis set. In this program codes use 4 chemical computational methods: Hartree-Fock (HF), Full Configuration Interaction (FCI), Diagnoalization, and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE).
In the VQE method, the ansatz used is HEA HRy, based on the results of my thesis research that HEA HRy with L-BFGS-B optimization makes the calculation efficient and accurate.
