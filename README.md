# Quantum Computing for H2 electronic structure calculation.
### End-to-end H2 quantum computing
Calculation of the ground state energy of the H2 molecule with the STO-nG minimal basis set without PySCF. In this program codes use 4 chemical computational methods: Hartree-Fock (HF), Full Configuration Interaction (FCI), Diagonalization, and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE).

### VQE Method ansatze technique
In the VQE method, the ansatz used is HEA HRy, based on the results of my thesis research that HEA HRy with L-BFGS-B optimization and seed=100 makes the calculation efficient and accurate.

### How to run programs
Download/clone this file then unzip it -> open this folder -> run the main.py file (python main.py) in the terminal -> open the index.html file or API local docs.
